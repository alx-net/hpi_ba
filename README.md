# Logstash Configurations and SQL Scripts for DBT Performance and Energy Data Monitoring
This repository contains Logstash configuration files and PostgreSQL SQL statements designed to support monitoring and data analysis in data centers. Specifically, it includes:

- **Logstash Configurations:** Extract performance metrics of DBT models from PostgreSQL logs, including query durations and query plans, for efficient performance analysis.
- **PostgreSQL SQL Scripts:** Generate aggregated energy measurement device reports, highlighting anomalies, and device statuses.
- **Vega Configuration:** Custom Vega script to visualize many energy measurement device devices in one concise visualization.

These configurations and scripts were developed in conjunction with my bachelor's thesis, "A Monitoring Solution for Energy Data in Data Centers."
